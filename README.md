# hello-world
My name is Tobias and I'm a trained electrical engineer (M.Sc.) from Germany. I'm working as a research scientist interested in machine learning at the University hospital of Tuebingen.
## A place to store ideas and resources
Currently, I'm looking for project ideas that combine modern machine learning/deep learning methods with novel clinical issues.
